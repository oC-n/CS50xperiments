# CS50xperiments
My experiments based on Harvard's [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/) course, trying out concepts &amp; implementations.

To reinforce my learning, I am challenging myself to implement any concepts not covered by the labs and problem sets. Although I test that they work using the CS50 IDE, I welcome any feedback, particularly corrections or improvements in efficiency.
